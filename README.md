# MATH-501-Numerical-Analysis  
Programming HW#1 (Due: Jan 24, 11:59 PM):  
Implement the algorithm of the pseudocode in Page 36 of Kincaid&Cheney. Then run it in your own computer and detect the machine eps of your own computer. (email me with one brief PDF report and your code.)  
  
Programming HW#2 (Due: Jan 31, 11:59 PM):  
Implement the algorithm of Bisection Method on Page 59. Read the explanatory paragraph after the psedu-code carefully.  
Then run your own codes to solve the problems 19 and 20 on Page 62-63.  
  
Programming HW#3 (Due: Feb 7th, 11:59 PM):  
1. Implement Newton's method as the psedo-code on page 64. Then run your own codes to compute problem 1 on page 71.  
2. Furthermore, make your codes also available for solving system of nonlinear equations. Then run your own codes to compute problem 34 on page 74.  

Programming HW#4 (Due: Feb 19th, 11:59 PM):  
1. Implement forward/backward substitution and LU-factorization algorithm. Then run your own codes to solve problem 36 on page 137.  
2. Implement the algorithm for the Cholesky factorization. Then run your Cholesky factorization code to solve problem 36 on page 137 again.  

Programming HW#5 (Due: Feb 21st, 11:59 PM):  
Implement the algorithm of Gaussian Elimination with Scaled Row Pivoting. And then run your own code to solve Problem 22 (two ways: with or without scale pivoting) on Page 158.
